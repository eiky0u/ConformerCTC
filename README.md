## About

This repository contains a code for training and inferencing ConformerCTC model for ASR task. This template branch is a part of the [HSE DLA course](https://github.com/markovka17/dla) ASR homework. Some parts of the code are missing (or do not follow the most optimal design choices...) and students are required to fill these parts themselves (as well as writing their own models, etc.).

See the task assignment [here](https://github.com/markovka17/dla/tree/2024/hw1_asr).

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the project:

1. Install all required packages

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install `pre-commit`:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## How To Use

To train a model, run the following command:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 --master_port=29501 train.py -cn=CONFIG_NAME HYDRA_CONFIG_ARGUMENTS
```

Where `CONFIG_NAME` is a config from `src/configs` and `HYDRA_CONFIG_ARGUMENTS` are optional arguments.

To load model weights and example dataset:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/eikyou/Conformer
```

To run inference (evaluate the model or save predictions):

```bash
python3 inference.py HYDRA_CONFIG_ARGUMENTS
```
